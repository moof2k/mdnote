## A unique text editor

mdnote uses a dual rich-text and plain-text editor to provide a real-time 
_[what-you-see-is-what-you-get](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG)_
and _[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)_ text editing
experience.

Sometimes you want Markdown, sometimes you want a rich text editor.
mdnote gives you both, simultaneously, in real-time.

## Backed by Gmail

All of your notes are stored and secured online in your Gmail account.
Access them anytime you're online using this app or by visiting your Gmail
account directly. mdnote does not use any proprietary file formats that lock you
in to the platform.

## Open source, free software

mdnote is open source and provided to you free of charge.
